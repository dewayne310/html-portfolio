<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>
  I’m a detail-oriented and results-driven <strong>Software Engineer</strong> with an emphasis on <strong>Quality Engineering</strong> 
  and five years of experience designing and executing both manual and automated test strategies. My work has helped streamline 
  development cycles, improve software reliability by over 30%, and reduce regression testing time by 40%. I specialize in tools like 
  <strong>Appium</strong>, native automation through <strong>XCUITests</strong> and <strong>Espresso</strong>, <strong>Postman</strong>, 
  and <strong>JIRA</strong>, while bringing a strong focus on collaboration and continuous improvement to every team I join.
</p>
<p>
  I hold a <strong>Bachelor’s Degree in Software Development and Security</strong>, where I developed a strong foundation in software engineering 
  principles and quality assurance methodologies. I’m also a <strong>Certified Scrum Master (CSM)</strong>, which enhances my ability 
  to thrive in Agile environments, lead process improvements, and foster collaboration between development and QA teams.
</p>
<p>
  What drives me is the pursuit of clean, reliable software — and the satisfaction of uncovering bugs before users do. Whether I’m 
  optimizing a test suite, mentoring junior manual and automated testers, or learning a new automation tool, I thrive in environments 
  that value precision, curiosity, and ownership. I pride myself on my ability to learn new things quickly and often serve as an unblocking 
  partner on my teams.
